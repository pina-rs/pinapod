# Establish the Pinapod compatibility fork

Fork ZeroPod 0.3.5 into the independently versioned `pinapod` and `pinapod-derive` crates while retaining its Apache-2.0 history and on-chain byte representation.

This first release fixes compact accessors for multiple unequal vector tails, tightens the unsafe POD trait contracts, and replaces unsound wincode direct-borrow serialization with validated canonical encoding that does not read or disclose inactive capacity.

Generated compact views preserve generic type parameters without changing their wire layout, scalar-only compact enums compile cleanly under `deny(warnings)`, and unsupported length-prefix widths or generic compact enums now produce focused macro diagnostics.

It also adds optional `fixed` 1.30.0 integration for all signed and unsigned fixed-point widths. Fixed-point fields map to their alignment-one little-endian integer pods and work in fixed schemas, dynamic compact vectors, options, and schemas with multiple independently sized tails.
