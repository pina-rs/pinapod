# Establish the Pinapod compatibility fork

Fork ZeroPod 0.3.5 into the independently versioned `pinapod` and `pinapod-derive` crates while retaining its Apache-2.0 history and on-chain byte representation.

This first release fixes compact accessors for multiple unequal vector tails, tightens the unsafe POD trait contracts, and replaces unsound wincode direct-borrow serialization with validated canonical encoding that does not read or disclose inactive capacity.
